# DDOS
A client and a server aimed at voluntary DDOS.
###### Client: C#.
###### Server: PHP.

###License:
Please read the included LICENSE file.

###Purpose:
I wrote this out of boredom. I wanted something simple, that worked. However I realized that this can help a lot of people who may have trouble with learning c# or any other language for that matter, so I decided to release its source. This also could be used for your own purposes. You may also contribute new code if you'd like.
